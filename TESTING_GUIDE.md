# BOM Calculator Testing Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive testing framework systematically tests every JavaScript function in your BOM Calculator to identify and fix indented BOM calculation errors.

## Quick Start

1. **Open the test suite**: Open `tests.html` in your web browser
2. **Run all tests**: Click "üöÄ Run All Tests" to execute the complete test suite
3. **Review results**: Check for failed tests (red) that indicate issues

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ **Utils Functions** 
- Number formatting and parsing
- Currency formatting
- String manipulation
- Input sanitization

### ‚úÖ **Data Processor Functions**
- BOM data processing and validation
- Metric calculations (canBuild, futureBuild)
- Flat BOM generation and aggregation
- Make/Buy status determination

### ‚úÖ **Build Capacity Calculator**
- Make part capacity calculations
- Total build capacity algorithms
- Hierarchical capacity analysis

### ‚úÖ **BOM Hierarchy & MRP Logic** 
- Parent-child relationship calculations
- Array order preservation
- Multiple calculation run integrity
- Sequential processing validation

### ‚úÖ **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
- Malformed data handling
- Null/undefined input processing
- Division by zero scenarios
- Empty array handling

## Using the Test Results

### ‚úÖ **Green Tests (Pass)**
Functions working correctly - no action needed.

### ‚ùå **Red Tests (Fail)**
Issues found - these need investigation:

1. **Check the error message** for specific details
2. **Review the function** mentioned in the test name
3. **Fix the underlying issue** in your code
4. **Re-run tests** to verify the fix

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning Tests**
Potential issues or edge cases that need attention.

## Key Benefits

1. **Systematic Coverage**: Tests every critical function
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catch issues before they affect users
3. **Debug Assistance**: Pinpoint exact locations of calculation errors
4. **Confidence Building**: Verify fixes work correctly

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests after any code changes**
2. **Fix failing tests immediately**
3. **Add new tests when adding new functions**
4. **Use test results to guide debugging**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test File Won't Load
- Ensure all `.js` files are in the same directory
- Check browser console for missing file errors
- Verify file paths in `tests.html`

### Tests Keep Failing
- Check that `state.js` is properly initialized
- Verify BOM data structure matches expected format
- Review calculation logic in failing functions

### Performance Issues
- Run individual test suites instead of all tests
- Clear results between test runs
- Check browser memory usage

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Custom lightweight testing framework
- **Assertions**: 10+ assertion types (assertEqual, assertTrue, etc.)
- **Test Organization**: Grouped into logical suites
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and status updates
- **Results**: Detailed pass/fail reporting with error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Fix failing tests** identified by the test suite
2. **Add regression tests** for any new bugs discovered
3. **Run tests regularly** during development
4. **Consider CI/CD integration** for automated testing
